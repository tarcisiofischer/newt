# newt

Newt is a toy physics engine that I develop eventually. It is not a real engine
that you will use, it is really a project where I can test and learn
programming stuff. There may be a bit of computational geometry, a bit of
physics, a bit of software engineering, a bit of algorithms, and anything else
that I may find cool to put here.

I suggest you to use miniconda with this project, to handle project
dependencies. Inside this folder, type:

```
conda env create
```

and then:

```
source activate 
```

I use Liclipse to edit python code, but really any editor should be fine.
